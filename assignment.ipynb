        "\n",
        "1. Read the abstract. What is this paper about?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  In the paper, Wickham plans to address data tidying as an important component of data cleaning. In the abstract he discusses the structured nature of tidy datasets, which he states are easy to manipulate, model, and visualise: a column dedicated to each variable, a row dedicated to each observation, and each type of observatoinal unit having its own table. Through this paper, he plans to discuss the advantages of having a consisten data structure and mathcing tools for data analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Read the introduction. What is the \"tidy data standard\" intended to accomplish?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  The \"tidy data standard\" facilitates exploration and analysis of data, and simplifies development of data analysis tools. In other words, the \"tidy data standard\" is a method of standardizing data cleaning. In this introduction, Wickham suggests that there is little research to be found on how to clean data well, despite 80% of the data analysis process being spent on cleaning and preparing the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Read the intro to section 2. What does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, it’s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\"\n",
        "  \n",
        "  \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\"\n",
        "    This quote is compared to another by Leo Tolstoy in the introduction to section 2, which states that \"Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.\" Essentially, tidy data sets are standardized, linking the structure of the dataset with its semantics. This means that all tidy data are relatively the same in terms of structure, each with their columns, rows, and observational units. Messy data, however, are all messy in their own way, presenting a  dysfunctionality that consists of its own unique problems to be cleaned.\n",
        "\n",
        "  \"For a given dataset, it’s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\"\n",
        "    This sentence recognizes the intuitive natue of figuring out which components of the dataset are observations versus those that are variables, given how widely understood it is that each column represents a variable and each row represents an observations. What is difficult, however, is understanding what those variables and observations mean, especially for people who not familiar with the dataset. This is one of the reasons why we often create codebooks in correlation with the dataset, so that others interpreting or analyzing the data are able to do so effectively.\n",
        "  \n",
        "\n",
        "4. Read Section 2.2. How does Wickham define values, variables, and observations?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Wickham defines values as either numbers (if quantitative) or strings (if qualitiative) which make up a dataset. He states that values can be organized in two ways: variables or observations. Variables contain all values that measure the same underlying attribute or property, whereas observations contain  all values measured on the same unit.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. How is \"Tidy Data\" defined in section 2.3?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  A data is tidy if each variable forms a column, each observation forms a row, and each type of observational unit forms a table. Otherwise, the data is not considered tidy, as in the data is in any other arrangement that is not as described.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Read the intro to Section 3 and Section 3.1. What are the 5 most common problems with messy datasets? Why are the data in Table 4 messy? What is \"melting\" a dataset?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  The five most common problems with messy data include: column headers being values rather than variable names; mutliple variables are stored in one column; variables are stored in both rows and columns; multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table; and a single observational unit is stored in multiple tables. The data in Table 4 is messy because the columns are actually values under the variable \"income.\" In order to fix this, a new column titled \"income\" must be created and place alongside the column \"religion.\" A third column must also be created for the third variable, \"frequency,\" which does not have on in the presented table. \"Melting\" a dataset means to convert columns into rows.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Why, specifically, is table 11 messy but table 12 tidy and \"molten\"?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Table 11 consists of each possible day of the month as its own column, but these days of the month are actually values and not variables. Additionally, the \"element\" variable has variable names (tmax and tmin) rather than values. In contrast, Table 12 is tidy because it melts the days of the month into a single variable (date) and Table 12b gives tmax and tmin its own columns.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Read Section 6. What is the \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data? What does Wickham hope happens in the future with further work on the subject of data wrangling?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Wickham wants to establish a broader philosophy of data cleaning, rather than just about facilitating certain tools. He wants the tidy concept to be more than just training people how to use certain tools (like ggplot2) effectively, but rather create a more robust ecosystem of ideas and tools for data science as a whole.\n"

        "\n",
        "1. How did the most recent US Census gather data on sex, gender, sexuality, and race?\n",
        "\n",
        "The US Census gathered through a survey distributed to United States residents, collecting sex as a binary and race as a \"check all that apply\" (with write-in boxes for more nuanced responses on race). More specifically, questions pertaining to sex asked \"What sex were you assigned at birth, on your original birth certificate?\" and \"Do you currently describe yourself as male, female or transgender?\" \"None of these\" was also an option. An alternative version of this question includes \"Non-binary.\" For Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity, a question asks \"Which of the following best represents how you think of yourself?\" and included options such as \"Gay or lesbian,\" \"Straight, that is not gay or lesbian,\" \"Bisexual,\" \"Something else,\" or \"I don't know.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Why do we gather these data? What role do these kinds of data play in politics and society? Why does data quality matter?\n",
        "\n",
        "The U.S. government collects this data for several reasons, one of which being for public policy. Knowing the demographics of one's country is important for resource allocation, such as funding for education, healthcare, and infrastructure. Knowing the demographic of particular areas throughout the country can help inform how need is measured and government resources are distributed throughout the country. There's also the importance of understanding the kinds of people that make up the United States, so that we can make efforts to support and build an inclusive environment, especially for minorities who are subject to systemic challenges that are catered to more privileged groups in society. Demographics can also inform elected officials of the very real concerns their constituents have, whether it be enough mental health resources for LGBTQ+ youth, or racial equity programs that uplift people of color. Data quality is important to ensuring that policies are well-informed and effective; data that is poor in quality leads to misinformed policy decisions that could ultimately cause more harm than good.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Please provide a constructive criticism of how the Census was conducted: What was done well? What do you think was missing? How should future large scale surveys be adjusted to best reflect the diversity of the population? Could some of the Census' good practices be adopted more widely to gather richer and more useful data?\n",
        "\n",
        "I think one of the most pressing criticisms of the U.S. Census is its decision to lump Middle Easterners, Arabs, and North Africans with the category \"White.\" This essentially erases an entire group of people, neglecting their unique experiences and challenges as individuals living in the United States, especially in a day and age where this specific group of people are experiencing discrimination based on negative stereotypes that have been imposed on them. I think it's important to include categories that go beyond \"White, Black, Asian, and Other,\" since these categories can be rather limiting to those who don't identify in any of these particular groups. The same can be applied for data on SOGI. Because the United States is so diverse in race and sexual orientation, and because this is likely to only grow in the future, it's important to expand these categories so as to accommodate for individuals who identify with many backgrounds. A step in the right direction includes a \"check all that apply option,\" which accounts for this nuance in population demographics. Additionally, my concerns with the Census revolve around politicians using this information to their advantage, specifically in cases of gerrymandering or redlining, which specifically target low-income and minority groups.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. How did the Census gather data on sex and gender? Please provide a similar constructive criticism of their practices.\n",
        "\n",
        "As mentioned earlier, questions pertaining to sex asked \"What sex were you assigned at birth, on your original birth certificate?\" and \"Do you currently describe yourself as male, female or transgender?\" \"None of these\" was also an option. An alternative version of this question includes \"Non-binary.\" For Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity, a question asks \"Which of the following best represents how you think of yourself?\" and included options such as \"Gay or lesbian,\" \"Straight, that is not gay or lesbian,\" \"Bisexual,\" \"Something else,\" or \"I don't know.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "I think it's good that there is an \"I don't know\" option, as there are a large group of people in the United States who are still questioning their sexuality. But I feel as though \"Something else\" feels a bit othering or alienating, almost degrading to those who don't identify with sexualities that are more well-known. Allowing for an \"Other\" option or including an option for those who are asexual, intersex, or simply queer with no intention of labeling themselves, is important in terms of inclusivity.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. When it comes to cleaning data, what concerns do you have about protected characteristics like sex, gender, sexual identity, or race? What challenges can you imagine arising when there are missing values? What good or bad practices might people adopt, and why?\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the more concerning parts of cleaning data, especially when dealing with missing values, is lumping together categories or simply reducing categories to the \"main\" or \"dominant\" options that seem most prevalent in society. This could alienate entire groups of people who don't consider themselves as part of the \"main\" defining characteristics of society, and minimize the true amount of diversity that exists in the United States. It's also possible that people are more likely to impute values, which in itself is harmful. People have different reasons for opting-out of answering certain questions, and to impute an answer for them means to diminish their autonomy and compromise their ability to make independent choices.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Suppose someone invented an algorithm to impute values for protected characteristics like race, gender, sex, or sexuality. What kinds of concerns would you have?\n",
        "\n",
        "Any human-made algorithm can be subject to that individual's biases, which is the most pressing concern I would have. There's the potential for an overreliance on physical attributes, which could draw on demographic-specific stereotypes. Additionally, there could be issues related to misrepresentation, as the alogrithm could mistakenly assign certain identities to individuals, boxing them into cateogries that don't accurately align with their personal identities."
